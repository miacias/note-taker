# note-taker

## Description

  With rising expectations to be ever-competitive and always outperform others to get ahead and "make it" in the world, it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of all our endeavors. To relieve the pressures of doing, being, providing, and excelling, this note-taking app provides a place to keep track of it all. 
  
  In writing this project, I learned that the basics of building a server that can handle Get and Post requests is the first step to managing data. Additionally, as a bonus, it is possible to Delete notes. There are opportunities to enhance this project with Object Classes as well as building Put request handlers so that users can update their notes in a future version.
